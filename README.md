## Summary
*Collision* is a short, emotionally tense story told from the limited perspective of Coral, a six-year-old girl, during a car ride with her parents through a rainstorm. The narrative centers on Coral’s observations and feelings as her family dynamic unravels in real time. She is initially focused on her coloring and the rhythmic swinging of her legs, but her attention shifts to her parents' increasingly volatile behavior.

Her mother is distant and frustrated, while her father is recklessly driving and dismissive. Tension escalates between the parents through passive-aggressive and overtly hostile exchanges, with the father turning up the radio to drown out his wife's voice. The storm outside mirrors the chaos within the car, and Coral, stuck in the back seat, begins to experience fear and confusion as the car speeds up erratically.

As the drive becomes dangerously fast and unpredictable, Coral—terrified—screams for the car to stop. Miraculously, it does. The car halts abruptly in the middle of the road, the radio is turned off, and silence falls. The story ends with the family sitting in the still car, breathing heavily, the storm quieting around them. Her father quietly says, “Sorry.”

The piece explores themes of domestic instability, childhood powerlessness, emotional trauma, and the precarity of family relationships—all framed through a child’s limited understanding and sensory-driven narration.
